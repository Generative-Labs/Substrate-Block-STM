/// Benchmark for Substrate extrinsic codec.
///
/// In the parallel execution approach, a batch of transactions is passed from the block
/// builder to the runtime API, and then transmitted to the parallel executor. This process
/// involves one encoding and one decoding operation. Hence, considering the impact of such
/// encoding and decoding on performance is crucial.
///
/// Currently, we have only conducted encoding and decoding performance tests for simple
/// transfer transactions. The observed time consumption at the transaction boundary is very
/// short, which might be due to the simplicity of transfer transactionsâ€”quite small, around
/// 130 bytes in size.
///
/// In the future, we may need to conduct encoding and decoding checks for complex
/// transactions to ensure that transaction encoding and decoding do not become performance
/// bottlenecks.
